XPlore is a  location  based smartphone application for Android, intended to help players discover  more  about  their  surroundings through  a  serious game.  Players  scan  QR  codes  placed  at  notable  locations which allows them to ‘readmore’, ‘see more’ or ‘hear more’ about  that  location,  in  addition  to  gaining  points.  

XPlore features  an  achievement  system,  where  players  can  unlock special rewards at certain locations, as well as a leaderboard and  the  ability  to  add  their  own  interesting  location  to  the game.  We  utilise  several  innovative  pieces  of  multimedia technology,   such   as   the   React   Native   framework   and Augmented Reality,  in order to provide an engaging and fun exercise for players.
